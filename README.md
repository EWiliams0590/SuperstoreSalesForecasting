# Superstore Sales Forecasting

## Motivation
I was interesting in doing a time-series analysis and forecasting project to learn about new libraries and add skills. I obtained the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting) from Kaggle. The data is sales of a global superstore for four years (2015-2018).
